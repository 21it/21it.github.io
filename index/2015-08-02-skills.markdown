<ul class="no-bullet"><li>Haskell is my primary and the most favorte tool. I do have advanced level of Haskell including:</li></ul>

- Tagless final encoding, monad transformers, lifting and unlifting for efficient effects management.
- DataKinds for better phantom type parameters and [Singletons](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/singletons) for dependent type programming.
- [Lens](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/microlens) for efficient data manipulation and parsing.
- [Units](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/units) for dimential analysis.
- Template Haskell and Quasiquotation for compile-time computations.
- [Presistent](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/persistent) and [Esqueleto](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/esqueleto) typed SQL drivers.
- [Yesod](https://www.yesodweb.com/) enterprise web framework.

<ul class="no-bullet"><li>I am also qualified in other useful areas:</li></ul>

- Nix - strong medium level. Nix the best tool for deterministic builds, tests and development environment.
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - strong medium level. I'm not database expert, but I'm using everything what software developer should use to manipulate data storage. Expressions, transactions, joins, locks.
- Bitcoin and Lightning Network - advanced level as application developer (not as protocol developer). Bitcoin is the greatest achievement of the new millennium, which brings financial freedom and sovereignty back to people.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/) - advanced close to expert level. I'm using Docker and Swarm for development, builds and production. Docker is a very handy tool for MacOS and Linux compatibility.
- Linux - strong medium level. Definitely not a Linux guru, but happily using it every day.
